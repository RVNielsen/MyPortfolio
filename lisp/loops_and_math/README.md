# Loops and Math
This program takes two lists of integers and perfoms operations on the elemtents to get a final number as a result. It steps through each list using nested loops and looks at one element from each list at a time. Using those two elements the program will do one of three operations. If the two elements are equal, add the two elements together and to the sum. If the element in list1 is greater than the element in list2, multiply the two elements together, then add them to the sum. Finally, if the element in list2 is greater than the element in list1, subtract the element in list2 from that of list1, take 100 divided by that difference, and add it to the sum. After the loops are complete, the sum is displayed.
