# Assignment Grader

This program grades students' programming assignments. For each assignment, the script runs each student's submission with the sample input and compares it to the expected output. After each file has been tested, a text file called "grades.txt" is created and lists each student's percentage of correct submissions out of the total assignments checked. A star is put next to any students who may have hard-coded the expected output into their program.

## Installation
```bash
bash assignment_grader.sh
```
