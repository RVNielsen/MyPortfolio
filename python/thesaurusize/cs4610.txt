1. For everyone already in groups, thanks. For the 4 people not in groups, please get in one asap!

2. Data files for each project are up (google drive in the pa06 description) : pa06-hack4096 

3. I'm waiting on a list of contact emails for each project, but you should read their stuff first anyway.

4. I'm checking with Gosnell about timing of return. Tentatively, I made it a week from when we got the data (today).
