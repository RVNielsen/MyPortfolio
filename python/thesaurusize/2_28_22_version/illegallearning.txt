I was holding off in anticipation of additional guidance by this point but I regret that has not yet materialized. Due to a lack of resolution at this time concerning issues which had been brought to the attention of administration, today's class will be held VIA ZOOM ONLY. (Details below.) Please do NOT attend CS 120 where I will be conducting the zoom session without a mask, as from the view of administration this constitutes some sort of illegal learning opportunity and I can certainly not endorse such activities (until such time as may be officially approved through official processes).
