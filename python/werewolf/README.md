# Ultimate Werewolf: Role Randomizer
I made this program to play the social deduction game "Ultimate Werewolf" online with friends over quarantine. The program asks the user for the number of wolves and villagers guaranteed to be in the game. It then asks for the names of all the players and recursively divvies out a role to each player and displays the outcome in the form of a table.

## Installation
```python
python3 werewolf.py
```

## Usage
see example1.md
