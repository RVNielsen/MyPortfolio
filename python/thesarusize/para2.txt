Exams may be given during class time, zoom proctored, camera on situation. Or they may be take home. My discretion (but you are free to make your wishes known as a class). You will know at least a week ahead of time. The final exam will be during exam week (Monday 5/10, 7:30am–9:30pm) if it is zoom proctored. Otherwise it could be take home. Missed exams: It is expected that you will be at all scheduled exams. If you have a valid and verifiable reason why you cannot take an exam at the scheduled time, discuss your situation with me as soon as possible. If before the final exam you have 325 of the 350 available points, you are exempt from the final and will receive an A in the class. Homework is due by 5pm on the due date (in Canvas). Submissions must be organized into a single Word or pdf document. Don’t upload a bunch of picture files. No later homework will be accepted. Regular attendance is expected. If you don’t want to have your camera on, please put a photo or toon in your black box. Office hours: Feel free to stick around in the Zoom meeting after class for questions. Or, you can email me to set up an appointment for a more convenient time.
