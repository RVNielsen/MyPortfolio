# MyPortfolio
I started programming in 2014 and became more serious in 2018 when I began pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science at Missouri University of Science and Technology. In this porfolio are programs I have completed independently in the last couple years that show my programming style and skill set. I am constantly striving to improve and learn more languages and techniques and am currently looking for internship opportunities in software engineering and related fields. I have two previous internships, one as an intern to the CIO of the Rockwood School District and another as a threat hunter at NTP Cybersecurity.
