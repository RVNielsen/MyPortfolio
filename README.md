# MyPortfolio
Hi, my name is Rachel Nielsen. Welcome to my portfolio! This is a collection of projects I have done in the past couple years. The majority are not school projects, but ideas I had and worked on independently in my free time. I created this repository to showcase my organized programming style and unique skill set to potential future employers and co-workers. I am most confident in C++ and Python at the moment and am constantly striving to improve and learn more languages and techniques. I started programming in high school in 2014 and became more serious in 2018 when I began pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science at Missouri University of Science and Technology. I am currently a junior and am looking for internship opportunities for the summer of 2021 in software engineering and related fields. St. Louis area is preferred, but I am open to other options as well. I have had two previous internships, one as an intern to the CIO of the Rockwood School District (2017) and another as a threat hunter at NTP Cybersecurity (2020). Both were great experiences in which I learned the importance of constantly learning and adapting. Thank you for your time and feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn if you think I may be a good fit for your company!
