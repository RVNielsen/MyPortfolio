# MyPortfolio
Hi, my name is Rachel Nielsen. Welcome to my portfolio! This is a collection of projects I have done in the past few years. The majority are not school projects, but ideas I came up with and worked on independently in my free time. I created this repository to showcase my organized programming style and unique skill set to future employers and co-workers. Through making this repository, I have gotten much more familiar with git and have been more intentional about writing code that is direct and neat. It has also motivated me to work on more personal projects. I am most confident in Python and C++ at the moment and am constantly striving to improve and learn more languages and techniques. I started programming in high school in 2014 and became more serious in 2018 when I began pursuing a BS in computer science at Missouri University of Science and Technology. I have had three previous internships: an intern to the CIO of the Rockwood School District (2017), a threat hunter at NTP Cybersecurity (2020), and a research technician at WashU. All were great experiences in which I learned the importance of constantly learning and adapting. Thank you for stopping by and feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn!
