# MyPortfolio
Hi, my name is Rachel Nielsen. I started programming in high school in 2014 and became more serious in 2018 when I began pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science at Missouri University of Science and Technology. In this porfolio are programs I have completed independently in the last couple years that show my programming style and skill set. I am most confident in C++ and Pyton at the moment and am constantly striving to improve and learn more languages and techniques. Currently I am looking for internship opportunities for the summer of 2021 in software engineering and related fields. I have two previous internships, one as an intern to the CIO of the Rockwood School District (2017) and another as a threat hunter at NTP Cybersecurity (2020).
