# MyPortfolio
Hi, my name is Rachel Nielsen. Welcome to my portfolio! This is a collection of projects I have done in the past couple years. The majority are not school projects, but ideas I came up with and worked on independently in my free time. I created this repository to showcase my organized programming style and unique skill set to future employers and co-workers. Through making this repository, I have gotten much more familiar with git and have been more intentional about writing code that is direct and neat. It has also motivated me to work on more personal projects. I am most confident in C++ and Python at the moment and am constantly striving to improve and learn more languages and techniques. I started programming in high school in 2014 and became more serious in 2018 when I began pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science at Missouri University of Science and Technology. I have had two previous internships, one as an intern to the CIO of the Rockwood School District (2017) and another as a threat hunter at NTP Cybersecurity (2020). Both were great experiences in which I learned the importance of constantly learning and adapting. Thank you for your time and feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn!
